### Heyo.
I'm some guy in Marietta who likes computers. I'm quite opinionated on them, which clearly indicates my skill.

### Did you know that I...
* [Have a website?](https://nicklausw.net)
* [Keep that website open-source?](https://github.com/nicklausw/mysite)
* [Wrote a Discord bot that counts your words in an SQL database?](https://github.com/nicklausw/wordbot)
* [Wrote another Discord bot mostly in COBOL?](https://github.com/nicklausw/comparse)
* [Wrote a 4chan scraper?](https://github.com/nicklausw/chinscraper)
* [Wrote a C++ engine that can make games for Nintendo DS and GBA?](https://github.com/nicklausw/ndsa)
* [Wrote a Sudoku game for the Master System? (Excuse the source, I was 13)](https://github.com/nicklausw/sudoku-sms)

Want to be my friend? I'd like to be yours too! E-mail me and we'll find our middle ground for nerding out.
